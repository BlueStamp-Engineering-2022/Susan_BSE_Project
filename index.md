# Real Time Planet Tracking System
This project aims to make a system that effectively tracks celestial bodies (such as planet) with a fair amount of accuracy. It uses  algorithms along with a processing unit for the calculations and a servo mechanism to show the location of the planet physically!

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up most of my basic hardware and getting a good majority of my software to work. As of now: the GPS displays current latitude, longitude, date, and time (however it only works accurately if its placed outside); the MPU 9265 determines the yaw, pitch and roll angle; the potentiometer uses a dial that allows the user to choose which planet the laser should point towards; the servos use the calibrated data and turn to face the laser (which is attached to the 180 servo) towards where the selected planet is. However there are still a number of things that I need to fix including: getting the 360 servo to stop rotating continuously in a circle; align my pan-tilt setup at its initial position (both at 0°) with the 0° Azimuth of your my location; switch to using the outlet as my power source; and adjust the laser to a more accurate position.

# Starter Project
  
My starter project was the Simon Says game which was a relatively easy build since it was mainly soldering. The product is a fun memory game that lights up in unique patterns for the user to try and remember.
